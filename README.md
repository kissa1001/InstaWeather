This app lets you choose the weather type and will show photos of cities that currently with that weather with the tag 'city-name/weather-type'. 
At first this app was created using Instagram API and Open Weather Map API, but from June 2016, all the applications that made with use of Instagram data have to pass the approval stage by the State of Instragram staff. So I replaced Instagram API with Bing API.
